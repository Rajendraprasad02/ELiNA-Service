                Why is the gut known as our second brain? We have more
                neurotransmitters in the gut than the entire body. And even
                serotonin is produced in the guts. Improper care can cause an
                imbalance in serotonin and other neurotransmitters which in
                turn, significantly impacts mood, sleep and behaviours.

            <p>
              Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common in autistic individuals.
              This affects their daily lives and those of their families.
              Several studies have shown the gut-brain axis or the multiple
              biochemical signaling pathways that exist between the GI tract and
              the central nervous system have a potential link to autism
              spectrum disorder.

            <h1>Support Neurodivergent</h1>
            <p>
              Parents can support the child by giving them a safe space to
              freely be themselves and meeting their unique needs. Giving the
              child time to explore their interests can help the parent provide
              better care and plan activities that suit their sensory
              preferences.
            </p>
            <p className="py-5">For example,</p>
            <li>
              If the child needs plenty of physical activity, pick an area where
              they can be free to run, jump and play without harming themselves
              or others.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the child is sensitive to sounds or light (and more), try to
              use dimmable lighting or reduce the sounds of the TV or music. In
              the end, there is nothing wrong with having a child or a person
              you know who is neurodivergent. Be supportive and adjust to their
              needs.
