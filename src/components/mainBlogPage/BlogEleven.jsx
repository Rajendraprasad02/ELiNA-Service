                Role of Environment in the Communication of Children on the
                Autism Spectrum
              </h1>
              <p>
                One of the most crucial aspects of socialization that young
                children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) struggle
                with is coherent communication, and expressing their feelings in
                a manner that is comprehensible to those around them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by distinctive
                patterns of movement, learning, and attention that are brought
                on by a confluence of hereditary and environmental variables.As
                parents and educators of children with autism, there are
                numerous ways for us to enable healthy communication and promote
                positive learning methods that equip them to develop real-world
                skills and effectively express themselves. A critical factor
                that heavily contributes to effective teaching methods is the
                environment in which children undergo therapy sessions and
                general learning. Although this may be an easy factor to
                overlook when focusing on developing a child’s educational
                skills, the environment plays a cardinal role in the abilities
                of a child with autism.

                There are essentially three types of communication; verbal,
                non-verbal, and written. All three types of communication are
                ways of exchanging information. Most people tend to confuse the
                idea of speech and communication being one, whereas, in reality,
                speech is essentially a type of communication. Speech, more
                specifically, falls under the umbrella term of verbal
                communication. The need for communication increases for a child
                as they grow and develop, as their content (or exposure to the
                world and gathered information) increases. The first
                communication that always arises in children is need-based
                communication, and hence, whether it be expressing their
                feelings verbally or through simple gestures, speech is not the
                only indicator of formal communication.
              </p>
              <p>
                In conjunction with communication styles, language is also an
                integral component of getting through to an ASD child. Both
                receptive language and expressive language go hand in hand, and
                when developing speech, receptive is generally preferred over
                expressive. Receptive language indicates how the child
                understands the content spoken to them, and expressive language
                indicates how the child uses vocabulary to express themselves.
                If a child’s expressive or receptive language is
                underdeveloped,their communication skills will be impaired.
              </p>
              <p>
                From a child’s perspective, their world typically consists of
                their home, school, and therapy. If a child is guided
                effectively at home,generalization of the skills happens at
                school and therapy sessions, and vice versa. Modifications to
                the environment for therapy and/or learning spaces that
                educators and parents can enforce include layout, space,
                providing choice, noise levels, visual aids, visual
                distractions, lighting, and creating opportunities.

                Layout can refer to the way that the room is arranged in terms
                of furniture and general setup, as some children may be
                uncomfortable with sudden changes in their surroundings. The key
                to introducing major changes is easing them into an unfamiliar
                environment. This can be achieved by tweaking just a few
                elements in the room at a time, making the transition for the
                child smooth and successful. Lighting can affect the atmosphere
                of any activity, whether it be therapy or learning. Natural
                lighting and subtle, warm lighting as opposed to harsh,
                artificial lighting can make a world of difference in setting
                the tone for any session. In most cases, children with ASD
                usually have a corner of some sort or cozy space that they
                utilize to escape from their surroundings when their environment
                becomes too overwhelming for them. Keeping this in mind, it is
                always a good idea to organize learning spaces that are proximal
                to their safe spaces. Offering choices to children when they
                feel particularly incompliant on certain days when following a
                learning schedule can help the child feel less constrained by a
                premeditated plan and lower stress levels, while simultaneously
                being productive. Certain noises or increased volumes can also
                trigger feelings of discomfort and fear in a few children with
                ASD, and hence, locations that have moderate, natural background
                noises can be chosen for initial sessions. As the child slowly
                acclimates to varying noise levels, a healthy tolerance to
                sudden changes in audio can be achieved.
              </p>
              <p>
                Albeit visual aids and visual distractions are antagonistic to
                each other, they work hand in hand when guiding a learning
                session. Visual aids can include signs and safe words to
                indicate when a break is required or a need must be
                communicated. Visual distractions can refer to distracting and
                conspicuous elements (i.e., a painting or houseware item) that
                may make the child apprehensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, creating opportunities can be an effective method of
                developing a child with ASD ability to think freely. When we ask
                direct questions that offer restricted responses, the child may
                feel frustrated when attempting to answer only correctly. The
                pressure of getting answers wrong repeatedly may cause the child
                to draw back and close off. In order to prevent this, asking
                open-ended questions that offer the child some flexibility in
                answering can be much more efficacious.
              </p>
              <p>
                Albeit conceptualizing a perfect therapy or learning session is
                easy, it is most definitely not effortless to implement
                realistically. It’s important to keep in mind that we must
                strive to remain calm when we get frustrated, as this improves
                the child’s receptiveness. Verbal cues that identify with
                positive reinforcement when a child with ASD gets distracted can
                include; “Ok, let’s get back to this...” or “What are we
                supposed to be doing?”. By calmly redirecting the child, we can
                constructively achieve the set goal for the day, all the while
                not distressing them.
              </p>

                While you take the necessary steps to ease your child into a
                comfortable learning style at home and in therapy, Elina can
                help take the reins at your child’s education center or even
                assist you in acquiring more tips for embracing your child’s
                unique learning needs. We at Elina provide guidance to schools
                in their inclusion journey based on surefire and tested methods,
                as well as collaborate with public and private organizations to
                analyze current inclusion practices that your education center
                may provide.
              </p>
              <p>
