              WHAT ARE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES, AND WHY ARE THEY IMPORTANT?
            </h1>
            <p>
              Have you witnessed grandparents excitedly sharing sweet treats to
              celebrate their grandchild’s grand achievement—turning over for
              the first time?
              <br />
              Did your heart skip a beat when your little one said their first
              magical words or took their first wobbly steps? These momentous
              landmarks are expressions of your child’s ongoing learning and
              development since the moment of birth. While these developmental
              milestones are surely moments to celebrate for reasons other than
              scrumptious sweets, they can also be crucial identifiers of your
              child’s development or, in some cases, a call for support.
              <br />
              Besides healthy growth, developmental milestones in the early
              years can correlate to development and academic success at later
              stages. While it is imperative to keep in mind that all children
              aren’t alike and grow at varying rates, it can be beneficial to
              get a head start and support children who are slightly lagging or
              skipping milestones.

            <h1>How Parents Can Help</h1>
            <p>
              Tracking milestones provides information about the child’s growth
              and development and plays a pivotal role in forming the child’s
              identity and boosting their self-esteem. When milestones are
              slightly delayed, modifications in the environment and caregivers’
              behavior can help children catch up. However, milestones delayed
              beyond the window may require attention and intervention—known as
              ‘red flags’. A few common red flags in the mentioned age groups
              have been elucidated: Developmental delays can be specific
              (present in one of the four areas) or global (present in more than
              2 areas). Children with specific developmental delays, if left
              untreated, may lead to global delays or special. Needs conditions,
              therefore emphasizing the cruciality of early intervention.
