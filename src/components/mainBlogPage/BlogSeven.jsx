            <h1>Reading Habits</h1>
            <p>
              In a world taken over by technologies, having a balance is crucial
              for a healthy life. Especially the balance between technology and
              reading. As times change, children’s interests change, but if they
              are exposed to good habits like reading, they would have a good
              start to a balance with technology.

            <li>
              <span>If your child finds reading boring, </span>they are most
              likely to not continue reading. Reluctant readers will be more
              interested if the subject of the book is to their liking. So let
              your child choose what they want to read.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>If reading is difficult for your child, </span>take it
              slowly. Let your child read at their own pace. Start with easy and
              basic books and slowly move to the next level.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Set an example:</span>Children tend to copy the behavior
              around them. So reading in front of your child encourages your
              child to join you and start reading on their own. Also, talking to
              your child about your experiences with books helps them understand
              the value of reading.

              <span>Physical conditions:</span>If your child squints or
              struggles to read letters, check their vision to make sure they
              have any sort of obstacle. Get them what they need to help with
              the issue.

            <h1>Strategies for Supporting Neurodivergent Readers</h1>
            <li>
              Neurodivergent readers often benefit from engaging multiple senses
              while learning. Incorporate activities that involve touch,
              movement, and visual aids to enhance comprehension and retention
            </li>
            <li>
              Assistive technology tools can be crucial for your child. Screen
              readers, text-to-speech software, and speech recognition tools can
              help overcome reading barriers and improve reading.
            </li>
            <li>
              Minimize distractions, provide clear instructions, and establish
              consistent routines to support reading success. Creating a
              structured reading environment can help your child.
            </li>
            <li>
              Recognising the strengths and interests of your child can boost
              their confidence and motivation.
            </li>
            <p>
              Understanding the unique needs of neurodivergent readers is
              essential for creating inclusive and supportive reading
              environments. Digital media has its benefits, and instilling a
              reading habit might seem troublesome, but its effects are
              boundless. Books enrich children’s vocabulary, creativity,
              concentration, interactions, etc. And a developed cognition gives
              your child better opportunities to be themselves and still be good
              at many useful life skills with vocabulary, studies, behaviour,
              emotions, etc. Work with your child’s needs and reluctance and
              slowly instill the habit of reading.
