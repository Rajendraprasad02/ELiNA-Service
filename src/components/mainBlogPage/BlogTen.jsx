              WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST THOUGHTS WHEN HEARING THE WORDS NEURODIVERSITY
              AND FOOD?
            </h1>
            <p>
              The connection between them is not one that can be easily made but
              it should be one that needs to be acknowledged by parents and
              adults. We must understand that for children with Neurodiversity
              children, numerous eating difficulties can exist. It is of utmost
              importance that children with Neurodiversity develop healthy
              eating habits. It is the responsibility of parents and caregivers
              to pay attention to dietary sensitivities, food aversions,
              allergies, and intolerances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Food sensitivities manifest when the body's immune system responds
              adversely to specific foods. This results in a variety of physical
              and cognitive symptoms. Certain textures or tastes of food may be
              overwhelming. In specific to ADHD, food sensitivities have the
              potential to aggravate inattention, impulsivity, and
              hyperactivity. It is necessary to identify and address potential
              trigger foods. An elimination diet is a method for removing
              potential trigger foods and gradually incorporating them again.
              This is a suggestion for parents suspecting food sensitivities in
              their children. Credits to @miroleyley.

            <h1>Food Allergy</h1>
            <p>
              Food allergies occur when the immune system identifies certain
              proteins in food as harmful and reacts with various physical
              symptoms. It is important to note that not all children with
              Neurodiversity will experience food allergies and not all food
              allergies will have the same effects on children. Allergic
              reactions can cause not only behavioral or cognitive changes but
              can also create more communication difficulties, sensory
              sensitivities, and stress. Not all children can openly tell their
              parents, situations like this pay attention to kids being
              avoidant, reacting badly, or having meltdowns for certain foods.
              They may also be more irritable, and hyperactive. Trouble
              sleeping, or difficulty focusing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Children with Neuro-developmental disorders may be more prone to
              gluten and casein (A protein found in milk) intolerances. They may
              have difficulty digesting these proteins leading to
              gastrointestinal issues. Another common activity done not only by
              children but also by adults with Neurodiversity is having safe
              foods. These are foods people can trust to rely on or tolerate
              safely without side effects. An idea would be to have a
              personalised healthy diet for children with Neurodiversity. It is
              important to focus on providing a well-balanced and nutritious
              diet.
